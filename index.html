        <section class="Why">
            <h2>ABOUT US </h2>
            <p>My name is Martin Crown and I was born in Wimbledon, England and raised in the British West Indies, St. Lucia. My father introduced me to tennis at 5 years old as a ballboy for him at the local Woolshire common public tennis courts. I played juniors tournaments throughout Europe and the Caribbean. I competed in the Orange Bowl and reached the 4th round of the qualifying event. I also played 4 years of college tennis at Southern University and graduated with a BA in English and Journalism. I later competed professionally in California, Florida, and all along the East Coast. My most notable accomplishment was being a member of the Eastern Caribbean Devis cup team 1993, and reaching the 3rd round of the qualifying event of the U.S Open 1994. Additionally, I have been coaching tennis for over 20 years and have since built the Crown Tennis Team.</p>
